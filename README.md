## About

mINI is a very minimal [INI][] reader. I wrote it because I needed to
populate a ContextMenu at runtime from an INI file each time the
user clicks on it. Most readers I tried were either overkill, too slow
for realtime reloading or didn't support nested sections.

mINI is stateless and does nothing by itself. It doesn't build data
structures to hold the INI file contents. It's an abstract class with
a bunch of virtual methods. You override the methods to decide what
to do with your data.

For example, you override `OnSection(String section)` to do something when
a section is found or `OnValueEmpty(String key)` to report an error when
a key has no value. The default implementation for all methods does nothing,
so you only need to override the ones you want to handle.

mINI is currently used on [GaGa][], a minimal radio player for the Windows tray.

## INI syntax

mINI supports the following syntax:

```ini
# comment
key with spaces = value at root

[section]
key = value
key = value

; another comment, semicolon syntax
[section/subsection/more subsections]
key = value
```

Spaces are trimmed around sections, keys and values before calling methods.
Blank lines can trigger custom actions with `OnEmpty()`. Case sensitivity
and duplicate sections are allowed, it's up to the implementation class
to decide what to do with them.

mINI never raises exceptions. It works line by line. The only public method
is `ReadLine(String line)`. When a line can't be read, it calls
`OnUnknown(String line)`.

## Portability

mINI is tested on Windows 7 and 8, using the .NET Framework 4.0+.
Older versions of .NET all the way back to 2.0 should work. Mono should work.
It has no external dependencies.

## Alternatives

mINI is simple and lightweight, but sometimes you need a full-featured library
that can also write to INI files, merge them, etc... For those cases, I recommend
[ini-parser][].

## Status

This program is finished!

mINI is feature-complete and has no known bugs. Unless issues are reported
I plan no further development on it other than maintenance.
